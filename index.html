							<span class="container-text__about page-color--fiol">
								A podcast featuring the very best of the UK creative industry. An opportunity for them to tell their stories, experiences and views.
							</span>

							<p>In&nbsp;my&nbsp;spare time I&nbsp;host the&nbsp;podcast ‘The Design Jones’ which sees me&nbsp;have one&nbsp;to&nbsp;one&nbsp;interviews with&nbsp;designers, developers and&nbsp;people within&nbsp;the UK&nbsp;creative scene. The&nbsp;focus is&nbsp;on&nbsp;anything and&nbsp;everything with&nbsp;a view to&nbsp;share the&nbsp;stories of&nbsp;the people behind&nbsp;the work.</p>

							<p>With&nbsp;the aim&nbsp;to&nbsp;release episodes&nbsp;twice a&nbsp;month there is&nbsp;always the&nbsp;challenge of&nbsp;doing so&nbsp;around&nbsp;work. So&nbsp;far&nbsp;I&nbsp;have enjoyed every second of&nbsp;creating the&nbsp;podcast and&nbsp;hope to&nbsp;do&nbsp;so&nbsp;for&nbsp;as&nbsp;long as&nbsp;I&nbsp;can. Each episode is&nbsp;recorded, edited and&nbsp;mastered as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;published and&nbsp;promoted by&nbsp;myself.</p>

							<p>In&nbsp;2016 I&nbsp;had&nbsp;the&nbsp;pleasure of&nbsp;upgrading the&nbsp;TDJ&nbsp;website with&nbsp;my good friend Steve Hitchman &nbsp;to create a&nbsp;easy to&nbsp;use&nbsp;and&nbsp;pain free listening experience that&nbsp;worked seamlessly across&nbsp;desktop and&nbsp;mobile. This&nbsp;was a&nbsp;particularly close to&nbsp;heart challenge for&nbsp;me&nbsp;as&nbsp;I&nbsp;am&nbsp;an&nbsp;avid podcast listener and&nbsp;have always found the&nbsp;accompanying websites stuck in&nbsp;the&nbsp;past.</p>

							<p>The name is a nod back to my second biggest love, basketball. Based on a Barry White version of a Cheech & Chong song called The Basketball Jones in which a Jones is described as an obsession, an undeniable passion and the love for someone or something. The Design Jones is produced with the primary goal of showing my love for being creative and the industry itself.</p>

							<h2 class="container-text__h2 page-color--golub ">DESIGN MATTERS</h2>

							<span class="container-text__about page-color--golub">
								The last ever 'Design Matters' illustration for Computer Arts magazine.
							</span>

							<p>July 2016’s edition of Computer Arts saw the last Design Matters which I feel hugely privileged to have been able to produce.</p>

								<p>The concept behind the illustration was to depict how design has led me to find a path in my life. Through a confusing often wild looking world there is a spot where you will find something clear. Something that may present itself when situations are flipped on their heads and inverting them. For me this was design and has led me to have a strong belief that design matters in all aspects of life no matter how small.</p>

								<p>The printed illustration was created in Adobe illustrator while an animated version for the digital magazine was created in Cinema4D and Adobe After Effects. For the animated version I carried on with the idea of finding light in situations quite literally by turning the 2D illustration into a 3D glow in the dark model. I then animated this to flicker on in a way reminiscent of a fluorescent bulb</p>

							<span class="container-text__about page-color--fiol">
								Taking part in the 2017 edition of typographic challenge '36 Days of Type'
							</span>

							<p>36 Days of Type is a project that invites Designers, Illustrators and Graphic Artists to express their particular view on letters and numbers of our alphabet. ‘</p>

								<p>I used my first time participating in Nina Sans and Rafa Goicoechea’s open project to explore what I could do with some strict limits. These limitations were colour, program and time. I gave myself two colours (not including shades), one program (Cinima4D) and only half an hour to complete each letter which included render time.</p>

								<p>These limits allowed me to work within Cinema4D and learn how far I could push the default effectors whilst learning how they work and their intricacies and limits. Once I had a lighting, materials and scene set up to allow me to model freely without worrying about the colours and the way type was lit I found I had endless possibilities.</p>

								<p>What I found most interesting about creating this project was how different the outcomes can be using the same techniques to varying levels. One effector used with high strength could wield a greatly different result on a low strength level.</p>

								Experimenting with duotone images and pixel sorting in photoshop and processing.js.
							</span>

							<p>As a way of getting back into processing.js I wanted to create a simple project where I could generate similar, detailed outcomes with limited control. Each image starts off as a photograph I have taken and then set up as a duotone image. This is then distorted in photoshop to create something abstract. Sometimes this is done with one layer of distortion all the way up to complex layering. These images are then loaded into a processing sketch which pixel sorts them into the final images. The sketch is run multiple times to reach the desired effect. The processing sketch is an adaptation of <a href="#">Kim Asendorf’s Pixel Sort.</a></p>
